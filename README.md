The Java Quiz Application utilizes several key technologies and concepts:

1. **Java**: The core programming language used for building the application, known for its platform independence and robust performance.
2. **Swing**: A GUI widget toolkit for Java, enabling the creation of the application's graphical user interface.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilized throughout the project, allowing for modular and reusable code through the use of classes and objects.
4. **Event Handling**: Used for managing user interactions with the GUI, such as button clicks and form submissions.

The project showcases the use of these technologies to create an interactive and user-friendly quiz application. For more details, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brajesh-010/Java-Quiz-Application).
